#CSE 841 Project

#C Code Fault Localization via Markov Logic

This fork contains the modifications I made to pycparser in order to assist in
my project for the CSE 841 FS17 course at Michigan State University.

My project also used [pracmln](http://www.pracmln.org/) and a software system
from the [Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository](http://sir.unl.edu/
portal/index.php).

All changes made within this repo that deviate from the main pycparser branch
are marked with "841" in some way.

generate_coverage_841.py was originally in the folder above this one, and is
currently modeled for use with a single software system. The end goal is to
modify the file in order to be extensible and used on any software system.
